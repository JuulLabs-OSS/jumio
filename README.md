```ruby
Jumio.configure do |config|
  config.api.secret = 'your_api_secret'
  config.api.token = 'your_api_token'

  config.merchant.app_name = 'your app name'
  config.merchant.company_name = 'your company name'
  config.merchant.version = Jumio::VERSION
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

To execute tests, run `bundle exec rake spec`.
